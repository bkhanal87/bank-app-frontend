## Description
This is an application that allows clients to add users, update users, view the details of the added users, and delete users, if required. This application's frontend is created using latest version of Angular and Typescript.
The backend is entirely created using Java.

## User Story
As a bank application user, I want to be able to add, update, and delete users and view their details. 

## Features
Visit my application by navigating to https://bkhanal87.github.io/bank-app-frontend/. Once you are able to access the application, you can add as many users as you would like, update their information, as needed, view details of respective user, and 
delete user that is no longer needed. Since this is a single page application, you do not have to navigate to several different urls to navigate to respective pages. If you'd like to learn more about single page applications, https://www.ramotion.com/blog/single-page-application-architecture/ is a link to the document.

## Motivation for development
I browsed through the internet and noticed that there aren't very many single page applications that provide clients with an interface which provides seamless experience yet providing all functionalities they are looking for. My application does just that. 

## Challenges
This project took me several months to complete, as I wanted to do the backend with Java. Managing time was a bit challenging; however, with a positive mindset and a continously learning attitude, I was able to complete it. 

## Successes
I was able to complete the whole application on my own with little or not help. It also helped me in polishing my version control skills. 

## Directions for future development
I have tons of ideas on how to scale this project. I know it's a bit basic application now but as time passes, I am hoping to make this a full blown bank application with hundreds of cool features.

## Installation

## Technologies

## Usage

## Demo


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
